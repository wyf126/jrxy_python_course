## Python in Finance

Applying Python in solving practical issues in finance.  Materials in this repo are designed for students taking my course 《Python在金融中的应用》以及《基于机器学习的投资分析》. 

If you have any query or would like to contribute, I would be very happy to hear from you by email ni.he@qq.com. 

### Software 

+ Python 3.* 

+ [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (Spyder)    You can download the latest official version from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/), and if you experienced a bad connection, a mirror site maintained by Tsinghua is available [here](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/archive/).  Tutorial in Chinese is available [here](https://www.jianshu.com/p/62f155eb6ac5). 

  *You could surely use other IDE for programming*

### Data source
+ Tushare  (http://www.tushare.org or https://tushare.pro/)
+ IEX Finance  (https://pypi.org/project/iexfinance/)
